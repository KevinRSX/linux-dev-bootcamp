# OrderLab Linux Development Guide
 
This bootcamp is created to facilitate research projects in our lab that
require modifying the Linux kernel.  The main content is hosted in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/OrderLab/linux-dev-bootcamp/wiki) It covers tutorials
on various aspects of kernel development, such as setting up the virtual
machine environment, compiling the kernel, and configuring the code editor.

The tutorials in the wiki are a group knowledge base. Members who use the wiki
have the responsibilities to contribute and collaboratively maintain it. The
responsibilities include but are not limited to:

The wiki pages can be edited through the GitHub web interfaces or like regular 
docs locally. For the latter,
