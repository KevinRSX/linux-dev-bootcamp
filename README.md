# OrderLab Linux Development Guide
 
This bootcamp is created to facilitate research projects in our lab that
require modifying the Linux kernel.  The documentation is hosted in [http://orderlab.io/linux-dev-bootcamp](http://orderlab.io/linux-dev-bootcamp) 
(source in [docs/source](docs/source) folder). It covers tutorials
on various aspects of kernel development, such as setting up the virtual
machine environment, compiling the kernel, and configuring the code editor.
